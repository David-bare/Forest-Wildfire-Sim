    "This simulation shows a forest whose trees are constantly growing and then being \n",
    "burned down. On each step of the simulation, there is initially 1 percent chance that a blank space grows into a tree and a 1 percent chance that a tree is struck by lightning and burns, the percentages were later changed to 5 percent and 9 percent respectively. Fires will spread to adjacent trees, so a densely packed forest is more likely to suffer a larger fire than a sparsely packed one.

    "This simulation is an example of emergent behavior—the interaction between simple parts in a system creating complicated patterns. Empty spaces grow into trees, lightning turns trees into fire, and fire turns trees back into empty spaces while spreading to neighboring trees. By adjusting the tree growth and lightning strike rate, you can cause the forest to display different phenomena. For example, a low lightning chance but high growth rate causes large, constant forest fires, since the trees tend to be near each other and quickly replenish. A low growth rate but high lightning strike chance \n",
    "creates several small fires that quickly extinguish due to a lack of nearby trees. We don’t explicitly program any of this behavior; rather, it naturally emerges from the system that we created."

    "This simulation can be used to look into how to contain and prevent the spread of wildfires in different parts of the world. As mentioned earlier in the project, fires will spread to adjacent trees and so a densely packed forest is more likely to suffer a larger fire than a sparsely packed one, this can help to strategically reduce how dense a forest will be by cutting down trees or carrying out other measures to prevent the rapid spread of fire if a particular tree or a part of the forest catches fire.
